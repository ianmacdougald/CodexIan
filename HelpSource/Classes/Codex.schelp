DESCRIPTION::
Codex establishes a workflow both for developing and interacting with objects that are comprised of interconnected scriptable modules. The class organizes collections of modules within a directory that it maintains, providing a simple interface for manipulating these collectionsâ€”by loading them, unloading them, cloning them, and generating them from templates (see link::Classes/CodexTemplater::). In this way, each Codex-typed class is free to focus on defining interesting behaviors for its respective modules rather than dealing with the pesky details of their storage and management.

note::Codex should not be instantiated. Rather, it is meant to encapsulate behaviors on behalf of its subclasses. So instance those instead.
::

CLASSMETHODS::

method::new
Creates a new instance.

argument::moduleSet
A string or symbol representing a relative path or a string representing an absolute path to a folder of modules.
argument::from
A string or symbol representing a relative path or a string representing an absolute path to a folder to clone a new set of modules from.

method::basicNew 
Creates a new instance without loading modules. 

After creation, use the instance method link::Classes/Codex#-initCodex#initCodex:: to initialize the modules.
method::directory
Gets and (persistently) sets the path to the directory of modules for all subclasses of Codex. For further details, see link::Classes/CodexStorage::.
note::Before using a subclass of Codex for the first time, be sure to configure the path to the directory of modules. This can be done either through the interface of Codex or any of its subclasses. However, any change made will affect all subclasses of Codex.
code::
//Check where the directory is.
Codex.directory.postln;

//Replace this path with something you prefer.
Codex.directory = "~/Documents/scmodules".standardizePath;
::
::

private::defaultDirectory
private::checkDefaults

method::classFolder
Gets the path to the folder where all of the collections of modules for a given Codex-typed class are stored.

method::moduleSets
Gets the names of the moduleSets that currently exist for the class.

method::cache
Gets a link::Classes/Dictionary:: storing sets of modules.
method::clearCache
Clears the cache, forcing the class to reload the modules from scripts the next time a given set is requested.
method::allCaches
Gets the instance link::Classes/CodexCache:: that stores each cache on behalf of the subclasses of Codex.
private::addModules
private::asPath
private::copyFiles
private::copyModules
private::copyVersions
method::contribute
Manages versions of pre-configured modules that are shipped with a class inheriting from Codex. 
note::
To make a contribution, overwrite this method by adding an array to the versions list with a symbol or string representing the name of the pre-configured set of modules and a path to their location like this:

code::
	*contribute { | versions | 
		versions.add([\example, "/Path/To/Example/Modules"]);

		versions.add([\anotherExample, "/Another/Example/Path"]);
	}
	
::
::
argument::versions
A link::Classes/List:: to which a developer can add their contribution. 
private::isVersion
private::getModules
private::loadScripts
private::makeTemplates
private::notAt
private::processFolders
private::scriptKey
private::shouldAdd
private::template

INSTANCEMETHODS::
method::moduleFolder
Gets the path to the folder where the modules currently loaded into the instance are stored.

private::loadModules
private::initComposite

method::modules
Gets an link::Classes/Event:: containing the loaded modules.

method::reloadScripts
Reloads modules into the cache from scripts, and makes copies them into link::#-modules::.
method::reloadModules
Copies modules from the cache into link::#-modules::.

private::getModuleName

method::moduleSet
Gets and sets the current moduleSet.
argument::newSet
A symbol specifying the new set of modules to load. Setting moduleSet will in turn load the new resources.
argument::from
A symbol referring to an existing set of modules to copy if the new module name does not exist yet.

method::moduleSets
Gets the moduleSets that currently exist for the class.

method::addModule
Adds a module to link::Classes/Codex#-modules#-modules:: by creating a new teletype::.scd:: file in the modules' folder and then calls link::Classes/Codex#-reloadScripts#-reloadScripts::.
argument::moduleName
A symbol
argument::templateType
A symbol corresponding to one of the available templating methods of link::Classes/CodexTemplater::.

method::open
argument::... keys
The symbols or string specifying which modules' files should be opened.

method::open_scqt
argument::... keys
The symbols or string specifying which modules' files should be opened.

method::open_scvim 
Open a single module or group of modules using scvim.
argument::shell
A String representing the name of the shell to use to open vim/nvim.
argument::neovim
A link::Classes/Boolean:: determining whether to use scvim or scnvim. 
argument::vertically
A Boolean determining if modules files will be opened vertically or horizontally.
argument::... keys 
The symbols or string specifying which modules' files should be opened.

method::openModules
Open all of the modules' associated scripts.

method::closeModules
Close all of the open module files. 
note::This is only implemented for scqt.::

private::doesNotUnderstand
method::know 
If set to true, the instance interprets method calls as look-ups in the collection of modules. This behavior is similar to link::Classes/IdentityDictionary#-know::

method::initCodex
Loads the modules into the instance.
argument::from
A string or symbol representing a relative path or a string representing an absolute path to a folder to clone a new set of modules from.
