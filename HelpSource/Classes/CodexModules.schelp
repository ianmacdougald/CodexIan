DESCRIPTION::
CodexModules is a subclass of link::Classes/Environment:: that was developed to store modules on behalf of link::Classes/Codex::. Specifically, CodexModules is responsible for both compiling and executing scripts and also renaming link::Classes/SynthDef:: modules (see link::Guides/Codices#SynthDef names::). This is done by managing and manipulating instances of link::Classes/CodexObject::.

CLASSMETHODS:: 
method::new 
Returns a new instance of CodexModules. If a path to a folder filled with teletype::.scd:: scripts is supplied, the instance will be filled with instances of link::Classes/CodexModule::. 
argument::folder 
A string.

INSTANCEMETHODS::
method::loadAll
Evaluates each CodexObject, replacing it with its result. If the object returns a SynthDef, the SynthDef is renamed. 
argument::... labels
Symbols that will be prepended to a SynthDef's preexisting name.

method::addToEnvir
Adds an instance of CodexObject to the environment.
argument::key 
A symbol indicating the name of the module.
argument::func
A function.

method::unpackModule 
Evaluates a CodexObject, replacing it with its result. 
argument::key 
The symbol key associated with the module
argument:: ... args 
Arguments to pass to CodexObject when evaluating it.

method::clear
Clears the environment and removes all SynthDef modules from the server.

EXAMPLES:: 
code::
~path = Main.packages.asDict.at(\Codices)+/+"Examples/Modules";

//Returns an instance filled with CodexModule objects filled with compiled scripts
~modules = CodexModules(~path);

//Evaluates each module, replacing it with its result in the environment
~modules.loadAll;

//Boot the server, and add a label to the SynthDef
s.boot; 

~modules2 = CodexModules(~path);
~modules2.loadAll(\testing, \modules);

~name = ~modules2.synthDef.name;

//Test the Synth
Synth(~name);

//Clearing the modules will remove the SynthDef
~modules2.clear;
Synth(~name);
